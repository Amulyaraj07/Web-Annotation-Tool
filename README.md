   - There are two types of screenshots you can save:
     1. **Annotation Screenshot:** This captures only the annotations without the webpage content. Useful for sharing or reviewing just the annotations made.
     2. **Web Annotation:** This captures the entire webpage along with the annotations. Useful for documenting changes or sharing a visual representation of annotated content.

5. **Close Sidebar:**
   - Click on **âœ–** on the sidebar to close it. The sidebar is draggable, allowing you to reposition it as needed. This flexibility helps you annotate without obstruction and take screenshots with full webpage visibility.

With these features, users can effectively annotate webpages, customize their annotations, and capture screenshots as needed. The draggable sidebar enhances usability by allowing adjustments and minimizing obstruction during annotation and screenshot capture.
